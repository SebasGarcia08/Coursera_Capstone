# Data Science Capstone Project 
In this project, we extract data pertaining to the Toronto City boroughs and neighborhoods, in order to look for its venues like restaurants, banks, airports, etc. Then, we focus in one borough in specidic: North York; here, we classify its neighborhoods by the similarity between its venues, i.e., what are the similar zones with similar venues that North York contains and which are their common characteristics?  
This project was developed within the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate capstone project.
